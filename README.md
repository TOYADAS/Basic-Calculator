This is a simple command-line calculator built with Java.
It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with user input handled through the console.
The application is modular, using separate methods for each operation, and allows repeated calculations through a loop until the user decides to exit.

- Interactive console-based UI using Scanner
- Modular functions for clean and reusable code
- Supports continuous calculation via user prompt
- Graceful handling of division by zero
- Easy to extend with more operations like modulus or power

Output:-(Example)
Enter first number: 10  
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *  
Enter second number: 3  
Result: 30.0  
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no  
Calculator exited. Goodbye!
